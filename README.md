# How to contribute
Simply fork and edit. You can also fork it directly from <a href="https://replit.com/@cldprv/lurkersio-level-editor?v=1#README.md">replit</a>.
Please add some comments and make your code <b>readable</b>. (Add some fancy whitespaces, ...) 
You are free to make as original PR's as you want, but we won't necessarily accept them...

<b>But most importantly, have fun contributing!<b>
